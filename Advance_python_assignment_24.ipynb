    "Ans: Circular importing means importing the two modules in each other. If suppose we are wokring in MOD1.py file and it is importing some function say F2() from some other module say MOD2.PY file or we can do vice-versa. What will happen is: This will give an import error.\n",

In that case it will return the module in which we are working on.

    "\n",
    "Ans: Attaching a program counter to the RPN interpreter application can provide several benefits. Firstly, it can facilitate faster execution of instructions by providing the memory location of the next instruction to be executed by the CPU. Secondly, it can provide tracking of the execution points while the CPU executes the instructions, which can be useful for debugging purposes. Additionally, it can help ensure that the interpreter executes each line of the RPN script in the correct order, which is important for the correct evaluation of the script."
