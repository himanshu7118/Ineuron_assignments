Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?
Ans: The try statement in Python is used to handle exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of a program. The purpose of the try statement is to allow 
you to execute a block of code and catch any exceptions that may be raised. By using a try statement, you can prevent your program from crashing or terminating unexpectedly 
due to an unhandled exception.

Q2. What are the two most popular try statement variations?
Ans: 1) try - except
2) try - finally

Q3. What is the purpose of the raise statement?
Ans: The raise statement in Python is used to manually raise an exception or error in a program.

An exception is an error that occurs during program execution that disrupts the normal flow of control. When an exception is raised, 
the program stops executing its current code and jumps to a special block of code that handles the exception.

Q4. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?
Ans: The assert statement is a debugging aid that tests a condition, and triggers an error if the condition is not true.

Q5. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?
Ans: The with/as statement is a context manager in Python that provides a convenient way to manage resources, such as files or database connections. The purpose 
of the with/as statement is to ensure that a resource is properly acquired and released, even if an error occurs during its use.
