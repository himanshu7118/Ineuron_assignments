    "\n",
    "Ans: When a user enters a stock-ticker symbol, several things can go wrong. Firstly, the user may enter an incorrect or invalid symbol, which can result in an error or incorrect data being returned. Secondly, the symbol may not be recognized by the data source being used, which can also result in an error or incorrect data being returned. To handle these issues, the program should validate the user input to ensure that it is a valid stock-ticker symbol before proceeding with any data retrieval or processing. Additionally, the program should handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the data retrieval process, such as network errors or data source errors, and provide appropriate error messages to the user."
