1.	What exactly is []?
Ans: It’s a empty list.

2.	In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Ans:
Ex:
spam=[1,2]
spam.append('hello')
print(spam)

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.
3.	What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
Ans: d

4.	What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans: d

5.	What is the value of spam[:2]?
Ans: ab

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.
Not: here you did mistake when define the list original list is look like :
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]

6.	What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans: you can’t check index by bacon.index[‘cat’]
You can check index by bacon.index(‘cat’)
The answer is 1.

7.	How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans: [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True,99]

8.	How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans: [3.14, 11, 'cat', True,99]

9.	What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Ans: The operator for list concatenation is +, while the operator for replication is *.

10.	What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Ans: Here in append() you can append any value at the end of the list.
Ex = [1,2,3,4]
Ex.append(5)
Ans : [1,2,3,4,5]

In insert() you can insert any value in any position inside the list.
Ex.insert(2,’hye’)
Ans: [1,2,’hye’,3,4,5]

11.	What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Ans: remove() and pop()

12.	Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans: Here I describe it in example
Ex = [1,2,’hello’,3]
Here list have different values it have values which we define in the list ex 1,2,…
Here in the string values we have ‘hello’.
So here list length is 4
But string length is 5
Both strings and lists have lengths: a string's length is the number of characters in the string; a list's length is the number of items in the list. Each character in a string as well as each item in a list has a position, also called an index.

13.	What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Ans: They are mostly similar but in one case they are different
Tuple is immutable you can not change define tuple values.
List is mutable you can change value inside the list.

14.	How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Ans: (42)

15.	How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Ans: 
Tuple of list:
([3.14, 'cat', 11], ['cat', True])
List of tuple:
[(3.14, 'cat', 11), ('cat', True)]


16.	Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
Ans: string and integer

17.	How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans: copy() create reference to original object. If you change copied object - you change the original object . deepcopy() creates new object and does real copying of original object to new one. Changing new deepcopied object doesn't affect original object.
